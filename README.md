# Dev

All my development stuff, as mentioned in the **About**.

## How to use

Depends on what do you want to use:

- `config-files`: dotfiles and configuration files that you could symlink
  directly. Instructions for Windows or Unix in the README.
- `copy-pastes`: stuff that I usually need to copy/paste, from Docker file parts
  to language features and more.
- `programs`: programs that I write and use frequently.
