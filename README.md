# dotfiles

Configuration files that I consider essential.

## Refactoring the repo and renaming from `dev` to `dotfiles`

1. [x] Move files from `config-files` to the appropriate folders or root
1. [x] Check existing symlinks to `config-files` and add a command for them in
       the `dotfiles-installer.sh` script
1. [ ] Delete the `config-files` folder
