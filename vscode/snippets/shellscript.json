	// Place your snippets for shellscript here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	// "Print to console": {
	// 	"prefix": "log",
	// 	"body": [
	// 		"console.log('$1');",
	// 		"$2"
	// 	],
	// 	"description": "Log output to console"
	// }
	"improve how bash scripts deal with errors by adding these to the top of the file": {
		"prefix": "set",
		"body": [
			"${2:# -e: exit on error}",
			"${4:# -u: exit on undefined variable}",
			"${6:# -x: print commands before execution}",
			"${8:# -o pipefail: exits on command pipe failures}",
			"set -${1:e}${3:u}${5:x}${7:o pipefail}$0"
